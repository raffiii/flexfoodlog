# Flexfoodlog
This project is a web-based food journal intended to detect relationships between food types and health-related anomalities.
As it stores sensitive health-related data, it primarily stores them locally in the browser of the user and thus only available on this device.

Analytics views will be added as needed/found helpful, if you think another presentation is suitable for your use case, feel free to open an issue or PR.
